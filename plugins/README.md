## Using Lerna

[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is being used to manage all the packages released
under the ``@blockly`` npm scope.

When you first check out the repo, or if additional packages are added, run
``npm run boot`` from the project root to bootstrap all packages.

Once you've bootstrapped the packages, you no longer need to run ``npm install``
in each of the packages.
